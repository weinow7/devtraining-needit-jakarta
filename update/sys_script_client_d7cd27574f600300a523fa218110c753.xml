        <description>When a user changes the value of the Short description field on the form the onChange script logic executes. This example generates an alert stating that the value of the Short description field has changed from the value the field had when the form loaded to the new value on the form. &#13;
&#13;
The onChange function automatically passes five parameters, you can use them in your script.&#13;
&#13;
    control: field the Client Script is configured for.&#13;
    oldValue: value of the field when the form loaded and prior to the change.&#13;
    newValue: value of the field after the change.&#13;
    isLoading: boolean value indicating whether the change is occurring as part of a form load. Value is true if change is due to a form load. A form load means that all of a form's fields changed.&#13;
    isTemplate: boolean value indicating whether the change occurred due to population of the field by a template. Value is true if change is due to population from a template.&#13;
&#13;
When a user selects a record to load, the form and form layout are rendered first and then the fields are populated with values from the database. From the technical perspective, all field values are changed, from nothing to the record's values, when a form loads. The if statement in the template assumes that onChange Client scripts should not execute their script logic when a form loads. The onChange Client Script also stops execution if the newValue for a field is no value. Depending on your use case, you can modify or even remove the if statement. &#13;
&#13;
The value of the Short description field has changed only on the form. Changes are not sent to the database until a user saves, updates, or submits the record.&#13;
&#13;
It is important to know that the value of oldValue is set when the form loads. Regardless of how many times the value of the Short description field changes, oldValue remains the same until the form is re-loaded from the database.&#13;
&#13;
    Form loads:&#13;
        oldValue = hello&#13;
        newValue has no value&#13;
    User changes the value in the Short description field to bye:&#13;
        oldValue = hello&#13;
        newValue = bye&#13;
    User changes the value in the Short description field to greetings:&#13;
        oldValue = hello&#13;
        newValue = greetings&#13;
    User saves the form and reloads the form page:&#13;
        oldValue = greetings&#13;
        newValue has no value&#13;
